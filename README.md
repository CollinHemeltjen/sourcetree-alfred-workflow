# SourceTree alfred workflow
Search bookmarks in SourceTree and launch them in Alfred.

Notice: This is a swift clone of [Alfred_SourceTree](https://github.com/yourtion/Alfred_SourceTree) by [yourtion](https://github.com/yourtion). Due to latest release of macOS 12.3, python2 has been removed which broken this workflow. So I reimplemented this workflow in Swift, It should be much more stable and faster.

## Install
### Prepare
1. you must have [SourceTree](https://www.sourcetreeapp.com/) installed
2. you should have unlocked [Powerpack in Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/powerpack/)
